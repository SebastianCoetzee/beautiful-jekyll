My name is Sebastian Coetzee and I am a software engineer living in Cape Town.

Some background:

- Born and raised in the seaside town of Jeffreys Bay
- Graduated from High School in 2008
- Graduated with a BEng in Chemical Engineering from Stellenbosch University in 2013
- Worked as a Chemical Engineer for a consulting engineering firm in 2014.
- Decided to turn my passion for software development into my career at the end of 2014
- Worked as an SAP developer for 8 months
- Software engineer at a consulting firm providing services to the financial sector
- Now I am a software engineer at ZappiStore working on the core team

On the weekends I spend my time surfing, playing golf or hanging out at coffee shops. I am a workaholic. Ever-since I started building software for a living I haven't worked a single day. I pretty much go to work every day, solve interesting problems and get paid to do it.
