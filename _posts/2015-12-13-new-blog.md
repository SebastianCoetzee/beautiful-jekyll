title: Welcome to the new blog!

So, my old blog was getting a little dated. It was a WordPress blog and with the recent craze around static sites I decided to switch over to Jekyll.

The idea with this blog is for me to have a place to share things that are related to my work as a software engineer. I will share some things that I think are cool and also some food for thought.

Hopefully I can share one or two things with you that excite me about this amazing field of software development. If you are like me, then you love your work to the point where it doesn't feel like work. Hopefully I can share some of the stoke with you.
